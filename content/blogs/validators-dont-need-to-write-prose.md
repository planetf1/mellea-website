[Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev), released last week by
[TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai), doesn't write text. State in, typed answer with a calibrated
probability out — Choice, Score, or Noul (a yes/no question answered with the probability it's
yes). All questions answered in parallel, in one pass.

That's the pattern TypeSafe calls a System One model — or a typed decision model, or a structured
classifier, depending on who you ask. The name matters less than the shape: unstructured input,
typed probabilistic output, nothing to parse. Jev is TypeSafe's hosted implementation; within days
of the launch there were open-weight alternatives —
[decider-2b](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-2b),
[Laya](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions), and
[Von](https://huggingface.co/wfzyx/von-1.0) — running the same primitives locally.

The [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49717558) is worth reading —
several people asked what genuinely separates this from encoder classifiers and constrained
decoding. Honestly, not much structurally: a typed decision model is a classifier that returns
a calibrated probability instead of a label. That framing is more useful than the name. The core
premise holds regardless: a validator doesn't need to be able to write.

That matters because of what validation costs. Run checks through a general-purpose model and you
pay generation prices to extract one bit of information, then write a parser for the sentence it
came back in. A typed decision model solves the cost side of that — but cost is only part of why
people skip validation. Skipping it is how you end up with a human checking every output before it
can be trusted. [The argument here in June](/blogs/loops-need-a-gate) was that this, not the
loop around it, is the hard part of agent design.

Look at what those checks actually ask. Is this total a positive number? Do the line items sum to
the subtotal? Is this answer grounded in the document that was retrieved? Does the output meet the
requirement that was set?

Every one of those is a yes/no, a label from a small set, or a number. None of them needs a
paragraph.

Mellea's unit of validation is a `Requirement`, wrapped in a repair loop. The design starts from
the cheapest check that will do the job and only moves up when it won't.

**No model.** `validation_fn` takes plain Python. Receipt arithmetic, a schema assertion, a test
suite — if the property is computable, a function checks it exactly, for free. This is the
cheapest gate available and the most reliable. Moving to functional tests inside the IVR loop took
functional correctness from 27.8% to 50.3% on the Qiskit Human Eval benchmark, same model, same
loop, [different gate](/blogs/qiskit-ivr-functional-validation).

**Constrained decoding.** Pass `format=` a Pydantic model and tokens that would break the schema
are never available to pick — the constraint is enforced at the token level, not caught after the
fact. `@generative`
gives the same guarantee from a typed function signature. No extra call, no second model.

**A general model as judge.** For semantic checks that aren't computable, `requirements=` takes
plain-English constraints and a failing check feeds its reason into the next attempt.

**A specialized validator.** [Granite Switch](/blogs/granite-switch) is a single Granite 4.1
checkpoint with validation adapter functions built into the weights — answerability, hallucination
detection, requirement checking, citations. A validator becomes a function call against the backend
you already have,
and because it uses activated LoRA the base-model KV cache survives each call. Chaining
validators doesn't recompute the context three times. On IFEval, the embedded adapter
[reaches 84% balanced accuracy](https://research.ibm.com/blog/granite-libraries-project-switch)
where prompting base Granite 4.1 3B gets 51%.

**Routing between them.** [SOFAI](/blogs/cut-llm-costs-with-sofai) tries a fast model first, uses
the validator's failure reason to repair, and escalates only when feedback stops helping.

The first three rungs work against any backend Mellea supports — Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face,
OpenAI, Watsonx. The adapter functions are the exception: that catalog is Granite, needs vLLM on
a GPU, and the model IDs are still marked `-preview`. Without it you drop to a general model as
judge on that rung — which costs some accuracy there, and nothing else.

Both approaches cover similar ground — scoring, guardrail checks, requirement validation — and
they wire it differently.

A typed decision model is a good fit when you need many checks in one call and want to branch on
the result directly in code with no parsing. At its core it's a classifier — it returns a
probability, not prose. The calibrated confidence is the useful part: if the probabilities are
honest, you can set a threshold and predict, across many decisions, roughly how often you'll be
wrong. That's what makes it work for routing and automated triage — you can reason about error
rates, not just pass/fail.

That puts it on a tier below a model that can explain what failed. A classifier can score;
it can't say why. The two tiers are complementary: use the classifier at the gate to decide
whether to proceed, use the generative model downstream when you need a repair reason.

---

Mellea covers the same checks — `requirement_check` and `policy_guardrails` are both there as
adapter functions — but the design is oriented around repair rather than routing. A failing check
returns a reason, and that reason is what the next attempt acts on. The score drives a pass/fail
decision that feeds the loop; calibrated confidence across many predictions isn't what the repair
loop needs. That's the design difference: one approach optimizes for knowing how often you'll be
wrong at scale, the other for fixing what's wrong right now.

Where Mellea goes further is when the check needs to do more than report a result. A typed
decision model has no generation capability — it scores, it doesn't fix. Mellea's IVR loop takes
the failure reason and feeds it back into the next generation attempt; the model sees what it got
wrong and tries again. SOFAI extends that: if repair stalls, it escalates to a more capable model
automatically — based on whether the output is actually improving, not on which model is
configured next in a fallback list. And the whole loop is observable: hooks fire at every
lifecycle point so you can see which requirements failed, when repairs triggered, and whether the
feedback actually helped.

---

The two approaches aren't mutually exclusive. A typed decision model is well-suited to the
*gate* question — is this output good enough to proceed, with a confidence score you can reason
about? Mellea is well-suited to the *generation loop* — keep trying until it is. You could wire
a typed decision model as the validator inside a Mellea `Requirement`: it scores the output and
Mellea drives the retry. The catch is that the model can't say why it failed, so the repair
prompt falls back to the requirement text, which makes the retry less targeted than a reason
would. Each
does what it's built for; the combination is worth it when calibrated confidence at the gate
matters more than rich repair signal.
